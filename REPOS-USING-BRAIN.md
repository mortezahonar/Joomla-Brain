## Active Repositories

### Plugins
| Repo | Type | Description | Status |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| [cs-autogallery](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-autogallery) | Content Plugin | Bootstrap 5 gallery with GLightbox | Joomla 5 native (services/provider) |
| [cs-smart-pagenav](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-smart-pagenav) | Content Plugin | Natural-sort article Previous/Next for numbered series — puts Psalm 2 before Psalm 10, where Joomla's only alphabetical option is a lexical sort that breaks at ten. Runs *after* core `plg_content_pagenavigation` on the same `onContentBeforeDisplay` event and overwrites `$row->pagination` for opted-in categories only; install script pins the plugin ordering so the "last writer wins" race is deterministic. Adds subcategory-spanning sequences and optional wrap-around, neither of which core can do. Repo carries a full annotated analysis of core's prev/next read from the Joomla 6.0.3 source — **including why a template override can never change the ordering** (core resolves `$row->prev`/`$row->next` to finished URL strings before including its layout). v0.1.0 scaffold 2026-08-13, not yet field-tested. | Joomla 5/6 native (SubscriberInterface, `EventInterface`-tolerant handler for pre-5.3 dispatch, custom `FormField` classes, category picker, GitHub Actions CI, update server wired) |
| [cs-joomla-router-tracer](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-joomla-router-tracer) | System Plugin | Router/URL logging for debugging redirect loops | Joomla 5 native (SubscriberInterface, com_ajax) |
| [cs-browser-page-title](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-browser-page-title) | System Plugin | Sets browser title from custom field | Joomla 5 native (services/provider) |
| [cs-userback-admin](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-userback-admin) | System Plugin | Userback integration with frontend/backend detection | Joomla 5 native |
| [cs-siteground-cache-for-joomla](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-siteground-cache-for-joomla) | System Plugin | SiteGround cache integration, auto-purge, admin toolbar button, log viewer | Joomla 5 native (SubscriberInterface, com_ajax, custom fields, header injection) |
| [cs-registration-redirect](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-registration-redirect) (private) | System Plugin | Redirects users to a configurable URL after com_users registration completes — closes the gap that the per-menu-item-only stock redirect leaves | Joomla 4/5/6 native (SubscriberInterface, onAfterRoute, full update server) |
| [cs-hikashop-login-redirect](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-hikashop-login-redirect) (private) | System Plugin | Catches HikaShop's "404-instead-of-access-denied" response and redirects Guests to login with a `return=` parameter so they bounce back to the product after authenticating | Joomla 4/5/6 native (SubscriberInterface, **onError** hook, full update server) |
| [cs-menu-item-conditions](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-menu-item-conditions) (private) | System Plugin | Per-menu-item, per-page visibility — adds a Conditions tab to the menu item edit form with **picker dropdowns** for menu items / components / views (no manual ID entry) and a **URL match builder** with operator selector (Contains/Equals/Begins/Ends/Regex). Strips matching `<li>` blocks in `onAfterRender` so hover handlers and embedded scripts (Turnstile, reCAPTCHA, etc.) never initialize on hidden items. v1.0.0 first stable release 2026-05-06. | Joomla 5/6 native (SubscriberInterface, `onContentPrepareForm` for `com_menus.item`, custom `ListField` for views, subform with operators for URL rules, balanced-tag walker for nested submenus) |
| [cs-edge-cache-marker](https://github.com/cybersalt/cs-edge-cache-marker) | System Plugin | Sets `cs_edit_session=1` cookie on `onUserAfterLogin` for editor-group users so upstream edge caches (Cloudflare, SiteGround NGINX, Fastly, Varnish, Bunny, NGINX proxy_cache) can bypass cached HTML for authenticated editor sessions while still serving cached HTML at edge speed to everyone else. Complement to per-cache purge plugins like cs-siteground-cache-for-joomla. v1.0.1 first stable release 2026-07-02. | Joomla 5/6 native (SubscriberInterface, `onUserAfterLogin`/`onUserAfterLogout`, group-scoped filter, session-cookie default, GPL-2 — public, update server live) |

## Adding This Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/cybersalt/Joomla-Brain.git .joomla-brain
```

## Updating the Submodule

```bash
cd .joomla-brain
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add .joomla-brain
git commit -m "Update Joomla Brain submodule"
```

## Notes

- **Legacy plugin format** = single PHP file with `<filename plugin="name">name.php</filename>`
- **Joomla 5 native** = services/provider.php with DI container and SubscriberInterface
- Both formats work in Joomla 5 due to backward compatibility
- Joomla 6 will require the native format (legacy deprecated)
